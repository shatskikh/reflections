When would you want to use a remote repository rather than keeping all your work local?

- in case of collaboration or working from another computer
 
Why might you want to always pull changes manually rather than having Git automatically stay up-to-date with your remote repository?

- Since other people (your collaborators might be commiting changes)

Describe the differences between forks, clones, and branches. When would you use one instead of another?

- Fork is cloning someone else's repository to your own, so that you can work independenly on it. 
- Clone is copying one repository locally.
- Branch is a history of commits

What is the benefit of having a copy of the last known state of the remote stored locally?

- Just in case you decide to work on the document without the internet access.
