When would you want to use a remote repository rather than keeping all your work local?

- in case of collaboration or working from another computer
 
Why might you want to always pull changes manually rather than having Git automatically stay up-to-date with your remote repository?

- Since other people (your collaborators might be commiting changes)

Describe the differences between forks, clones, and branches. When would you use one instead of another?

- Fork is cloning someone else's repository to your own, so that you can work independenly on it. 
- Clone is copying one repository locally.
- Branch is a history of commits

What is the benefit of having a copy of the last known state of the remote stored locally?

- Just in case you decide to work on the document without the internet access.  

How would you collaborate without using Git or GitHub? What would be easier, and what would be harder?

- Without Git and GitHub I would probably need to email the code changes to my collaborators. It will be much messier especially if there is a small change. 


When would you want to make changes in a separate branch rather than directly in master? What benefits does each approach have?

- When you're trying another experimental feature.
