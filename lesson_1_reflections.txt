How did viewing a diff between two versions of a file help you see the bug that
was introduced?

- it made my life easy!

How could having easy access to the entire history of a file make you a better

What do you think are the pros and cons of manually choosing when to create a
commit, like you do in Git, vs having versions automatically saved, like Google
docs does?

- Pro: since you can make more appropriate and logical additions. 
- Con: you manually need to make commits.	

Why do you think some version control systems, like Git, allow saving multiple
files in one commit, while others, like Google Docs, treat each file separately?

- since these multiple files substitute one project and all files are connected to each other.

How can you use the commands git log and git diff to view the history of files?
    
-git log shows the list of commits and get diff shows the actual differences in commits. 

How might using version control make you more confident to make changes that
could break something?
    
- since you can return to the previous version anytime and debug your code.  

Now that you have your workspace set up, what do you want to try using Git for?

- some Latex code
